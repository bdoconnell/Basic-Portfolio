            <p>Hi, my name is Brian and I am a lifelong Minnesotan.  I have always lived and worked in the north metro, Blaine, Robbinsdale, and Champlin to be exact.
              

            I spend much of my free time with my wife Julie, daughter Tara, and son Jack at our land near Lake of the Woods or at our lake cabin near Fergus Falls.

            My career path has been varied. After High School I joined the ARMY and drove tanks for 3 years to help pay for college.  I attended St Cloud State and the U of MN. From there I've worked in transportation, the mortgage industry, and most recently rehabbing single family homes.
